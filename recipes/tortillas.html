        <ol>
            <li>Add water to a small saucepan and head until warm. Keep the stove on medium heat.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix the flour and salt until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the shortening to the flour and salt mixture. Use fingers to rub the fat into the flour until it looks coarse. There should be now big pieces of mixture, they should all be relatively small.</li>

            <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Briefly knead the dough until it forms a cohesive ball. Add more flour if the dough feels sticky. Be careful to not overwork the dough or it will be tough when cooked.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into even pieces about 2.5 tablespoons of dough. Roll each piece into a ball, place on a plate, cover and let chill for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll each ball with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surfassce.  Keep other balls covered to prevent them from drying out.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet and add some oil to the pan. Ensure to coat the entire pan as the oil heats up.</li>
            <li>Cook each tortilla on the skillet until a few brown spots begin to appear, about 30-45 second per side.</li>
