# odin-recipes
The current project is to create a website that will include, 1.) a main index page, 2.) links to a few recipes within the main index page. 

Skills I will have demonstrated upon completion. 
 - Using appropriate elements and tags
 - Creating the HTML boilerplate 
 - Boilerplate utilization
 - Working with text
 - Creating OL and UL 
 - Inserting links and images

After finishing the project, here are the concepts that I feel I have a better handle of.  
 - Creating the boilerplate - memorized
 - Better understanding of how to do some of the formatting basics
 - Inserting links and images
 - The need for building the "house" of the website - why organization is crucial
 - How helpful Ol and UL are
